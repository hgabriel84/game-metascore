# videogames scores

This is an app that uses Android Architecture to keep Metacritic scores of videogames updated through web scraping.

It displays metascore, user score, and average score.
It also saves those scores in a local database to be displayed as updated data is fetched from Metacritic website.
Videogames can be added, removed, and marked as played.

This is only for personal use.
