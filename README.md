# videogames scores

This is an app that uses Android Architecture to keep Metacritic scores of videogames updated through web scraping.

It displays metascore, user score, and average score.
It also saves those scores in a database for better performance but it can fetch updated data from Metacritic website on user request.
Videogames can be added, removed, and marked as played.

This is only for personal use.
